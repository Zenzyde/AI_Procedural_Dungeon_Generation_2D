# AI_Procedural_Dungeon_Generation_2D
 A small game that came as a result of an AI course, based on the dungeon generation algorithm by Bob Nystrom: https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/

This small game project is more for showing my capability to use an AI algorithm to generate a dungeon, moreso than actually being a game. As such the goal of this small game is simply to get from the start of the dungeon map to the end before time runs out.

The starting room of the dungeon map is marked with green tiles.

The goal room of the dungeon map is marked with yellow tiles.

For both practice and performance purposes, the dungeon maps are generated offline with an editor-script and can be saved as prefabs.
